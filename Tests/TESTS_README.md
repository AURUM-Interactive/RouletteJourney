Tests are written by uploading two files: a .md markdown file containing the specific test or tests that should be checked, and a video file or files with the test case being tested in actual gameplay. Markdown and video files should share names, e.g. MovementTest.md & MovementTest_A.mp4, MovementTest_B.mp4.
