Tests are written by uploading two files: a .md markdown file containing the specific test or tests that should be checked, and a video file or files with the test case being tested in actual gameplay. 

Markdown and video files should share names, name should contain the sprint number when test was written and what was being tested, e.g. 
* 1_MovementTest.md & 1_MovementTest.mp4.

If the actual behaviour tests are split up into multiple files, they should be named either by describing what is being tested concisely, and/or by mentioning the specific test numbers in the .md file, e.g. 

* 1_MovementTest_CantMoveAfterDeath.mp4; 
* 1_MovementTest_1.mp4;
* etc.
