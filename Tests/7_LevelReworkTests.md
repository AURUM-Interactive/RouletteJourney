Expected:

Collisions work correctly: wall tiles are drawn on the wall layer and have collision with the player and other entities;

Sprite ordering works properly: floor tiles are drawn below the player, obstacles and decorations are drawn on top of the wall and floor tiles, and are able to be drawn above the player in specific circumstances (the player moving behind a plant);
