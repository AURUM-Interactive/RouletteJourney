<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A 2D pixel-style rogue-like game is being developed, where players progress through casino rooms, having to defeat the enemies inside in order to move on to the next floor of the casino. The main gameplay mechanics include:
* Levels are organized by floors with enemies, and the player ascends floor by floor until reaching the final boss;
* The player encounters enemies themed around casinos/gambling, e.g., goblins dressed as casino staff;
* An inventory system where the player has passive and consumable cards that help (or sometimes hinder) progress through the level;
* Various weapons that the player can use to defeat enemies, e.g., throwing cards or a poker chip used as a shield;
* At the end of each floor, the player has the option to gamble their cards in an attempt to improve their card abilities or gain new, better cards;
* If the player dies at any point in the game, they lose everything and start from the beginning – the defining feature of a rogue-like game.

_Roulette Journey_ is being developed by the following team:
* Arnas Šiūša, IF-3/2, arnas.siusa@ktu.edu – Project lead, Scrum Master.
